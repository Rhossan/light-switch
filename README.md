*Each Controller consists of two buttons and a selector
*Each button has two possible states: OFF or On
*The Selector can be one of three logical operators: AND(^), OR(V), XOR(+)
*Clicking on each button or changing the selector for any of the controllers will change their state 
*Each Controller is seperated by another selector, and the combination of state of each controller with the value of the selector will yield our output               
*Play around with this tool to learn how logic gates work!
